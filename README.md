## üí° Development Notes  

### Architecture  
The game is structured around these key components:  
- **GazeTrigger**: Handles gaze-based interaction for objects and buttons.  
- **PuzzleOneManager**: Manages Puzzle 1 logic (object selection in order).  
- **PuzzleTwoManager**: Manages Puzzle 2 logic (keypad code entry).  
- **UnlockDoorLogic**: Tracks puzzle completion and unlocks the door.  
- **HeadMover**: Positions the player for each puzzle.  
- **SceneSwitcher**: Handles navigation between scenes (e.g., Main Menu, Escape Room).  
- **GyroScope**: Integrates VR head tracking for immersion.  

### Known Issues  
- Gaze interaction may occasionally fail if VR Event System isn‚Äôt properly configured.  
- Puzzle 3 is still in development and not fully functional.

## üìù Future Enhancements  
- Complete Puzzle 3: Shape-matching mechanics with drag-and-drop via gaze.  
- Add a Timer UI to increase challenge.  
- Implement a Success Popup Screen on door unlock.  
- Add more environmental interactions (e.g., dynamic lighting, sound effects).  
- Support for additional VR platforms beyond Google VR SDK.  
- Enhance hints system with more detailed clues.
